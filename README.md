# About me

Hi, I’m Chao, a master’s student in Computer Science at Leiden University and currently a Data Scientist Intern at Elsevier. 

I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval, and Large Language Models (LLMs). 

I am always eager to learn new technologies and continuously enhance my skills.
